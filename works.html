          <p>Mumbai (formerly called Bombay) is a densely populated city on India’s west coast. A financial center, it's India's largest city. On the Mumbai Harbour waterfront stands the iconic Gateway of India stone arch, built by the British Raj in 1924. Offshore, nearby Elephanta Island holds ancient cave temples dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The city's also famous as the heart of the Bollywood film industry.</p>
          <p>The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were originally home to communities of Marathi language speaking Koli people.[25][26][27] For centuries, the seven islands of Bombay were under the control of successive indigenous rulers before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire, and subsequently to the East India Company in 1661, through the dowry of Catherine Braganza when she was married off to Charles II of England.[28] During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project,[29] which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea.[30] Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.[31]</p>
          <p>Mumbai is the financial, commercial,[32] and the entertainment capital of India. It is also one of the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow,[33] generating 6.16% of India's GDP,[34] and accounting for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai Port Trust and JNPT),[35] and 70% of capital transactions to India's economy.[36][37] Mumbai has the eighth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world,[38] and Mumbai's billionaires had the highest average wealth of any city in the world in 2008.[39][40] The city houses important financial institutions and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is also home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes. The city is also home to Bollywood and Marathi cinema industries. Mumbai's business opportunities attract migrants from all over India.</p>
